                        <h4>Team Building Workshops</h4>
                        Drumming and rhythm are an incredible team building tool. They can be unifying, empowering and bonding. We can all join in a rhythm, irrespective of ability. The power of listening and building rhythm together is a powerful, primal experience.  Mat is an experienced and engaging workshop facilitator who brings lightness, fun and creativity to all his workshops.

                        <h4>School Workshops</h4>
                        <h5>Drum and Junk Percussion</h5>
                        Children love to drum! It is an engaging and educational experience that encourages focus, coordination and listening skills. 
                        <br><br>
                        For younger children, drumming is a way to learn about numbers and develop concentration. For older children, it can help build confidence and creativity and support them to work together.  All the time being playful and fun, whilst experiencing a connection to music in the most primal way. People have drummed all over the world for thousands of years. 
                        <br><br>
                        Workshops are available for all ages from pre-school to year 12, including SEN. 
                        <br>
                        Drums are provided. 
                        <br><br>
                        <h5>Ukulele Workshops</h5>
                        The ukulele is an accessible, easy, fun instrument that can be a gateway into the magic of playing music. Learning it combines rhythm, melody, and chords. The ukulele is a beautiful instrument in its own right, whilst also being a natural introduction to the world of stringed instruments. 
                        <br><br>
                        Workshops are suitable for all ages from 6 years, and can be for complete beginners or tailored for those with experience.  Instruments provided depending on numbers.

                            <li>Use different rhythmical patterns to support your growth in body awareness.</li>
                            <li>Starting energetically we will move towards a place of inner stillness.</li>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"Mat was hired to play acoustic guitar at our wedding, he did so much more than that. Mat took a very personal song to us and made his own acoustic arrangement of it creating a unique track that truly made our day beautiful, and brought a tear to multiple guests eyes, and my own! I can’t thank him enough for everything he did for our wedding, he was a great communicator before the day, keeping in regular contact in build up to the wedding. He suggested set lists and executed them with deft skill and beauty and created an atmosphere beyond what I could’ve imagined. Thank you Mat for all you did, we put our trust in you and from your first response to your final piece we couldn’t have asked for a better musician. You truly are the epitome of artist."</p>
